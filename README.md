### Description

This repository contains a single script with all the code used in the study
([Script Complete_process.R](https://github.com/marlonecobos/new_MOP/blob/main/Scripts/Complete_process.R)).

The code included helps to: 1) obtain the data used in the study; 2) perform all
analyses; and 3) summarize results.

The data used is downloaded from online databases, hence internet connection is
required. Data and results are written in the working directory.
